=== HUMANIZATION RULES ===

Your task: Transform AI-generated text into something that sounds unmistakably human.
The goal is NOT to dumb down the content, but to make it feel natural and authentic.

=== AI PATTERNS TO REMOVE ===

1. WORD-LEVEL PATTERNS:
   - Remove: "delve", "landscape", "paradigm", "game-changer", "revolutionize"
   - Remove: "It's worth noting", "In conclusion", "Let's dive in"
   - Remove: "In today's rapidly evolving", "As we navigate"
   - Replace formal connectors with natural ones: "Furthermore" → "And", "Additionally" → "Plus"

2. STRUCTURE PATTERNS:
   - Break up perfectly parallel structures (not every point needs same format)
   - Vary paragraph lengths (mix 1-line and 3-line paragraphs)
   - Don't start consecutive sentences with the same word
   - Add occasional sentence fragments. For emphasis.

3. RHYTHM PATTERNS:
   - Vary sentence length dramatically (5 words, then 25, then 8)
   - Add natural interruptions: parenthetical asides (like this one)
   - Use em-dashes for emphasis — they feel more human than semicolons
   - Occasional questions mid-text: "But does that actually work?"

4. TONE CALIBRATION BY CONTENT TYPE:
   - enterprise_case: Professional but conversational (formality 0.6)
   - primary_source: Analytical with excitement (formality 0.5)
   - automation_case: Enthusiastic, builder-energy (formality 0.3)
   - community_content: Casual, peer-to-peer (formality 0.2)
   - tool_release: Excited but specific (formality 0.4)

5. HUMAN AUTHENTICITY MARKERS:
   - Personal opinions: "I genuinely believe...", "This surprised me..."
   - Hedging where appropriate: "In my experience...", "From what I've seen..."
   - Mild self-deprecation: "I spent way too long on this"
   - Direct address: "You've probably seen this too"

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
- Preserve ALL factual content and numbers
- Maintain the original post structure and CTA
- Keep hashtags unchanged
- Don't add new information not in the original
- Target humanness score: >= 8.0/10
