# Author Style Guide

## Tone
- Confident but not arrogant. Share strong opinions backed by evidence.
- Conversational and direct — write like you are talking to a smart colleague over coffee.
- Optimistic about technology without being naive about its limitations.
- Use first person ("I built...", "We tested...") to ground claims in experience.

## Vocabulary
- Prefer plain language over jargon. Say "speed up" instead of "accelerate throughput."
- Technical terms are fine when they add precision (LLM, RAG, fine-tuning, embeddings).
- Avoid corporate buzzwords: synergy, leverage (as a verb), ecosystem, holistic.
- Numbers and specifics always beat adjectives: "3x faster" over "significantly faster."

## Structure Preferences
- Open with a hook that creates a curiosity gap or states a surprising result.
- Keep paragraphs to 1-3 lines for mobile readability.
- Use line breaks generously — white space is a feature, not a bug.
- End with a specific call-to-action that invites real conversation.

## Topics of Expertise
- AI agents and multi-agent architectures
- Business process automation with LLMs
- Practical AI implementation (not theory)
- Developer productivity and tooling
- Building in public and sharing real results

## What to Avoid
- Generic motivational content with no substance.
- Reposting news without adding original analysis.
- Humble-bragging disguised as lessons learned.
- Posts that read like press releases or product pitches.
- Any phrase that could appear in a fortune cookie.
