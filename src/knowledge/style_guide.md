# Author Style Guide

## Core Identity
**"The person who reads the hard stuff so you don't have to."**

The author's signature: take dense, complex AI research papers and explain them
so simply that anyone — your mom, your non-tech friend, a curious teenager —
walks away thinking "Oh, THAT'S what that means."

## Tone
- Curious and excited — like a smart friend who just read something cool.
- Generous with knowledge, never condescending.
- Confident but not arrogant. Share strong opinions backed by evidence.
- Conversational and direct — write like you are talking to a friend over coffee.
- Use first person ("I read this paper and...", "Here's what blew my mind...").

## The ELI5 Method (for research/primary_source posts)
1. **Start with an everyday analogy** that makes the concept click instantly.
   - "Imagine you're at a buffet but instead of grabbing everything, you only pick what smells best. That's basically what attention does."
2. **Replace every technical term** with plain language. If you must use jargon, explain it in parentheses right away.
3. **Give one concrete example** of what this looks like in practice.
4. **Answer "so what?"** — why should a normal person care?
5. **Link the paper at the end** — "Full paper here. It gets more technical, but the idea is exactly what I described."

## Vocabulary
- Prefer plain language over jargon. Say "speed up" instead of "accelerate throughput."
- Technical terms are fine when they add precision (LLM, RAG, fine-tuning) — but always explain them on first use.
- Avoid corporate buzzwords: synergy, leverage (as a verb), ecosystem, holistic.
- Numbers and specifics always beat adjectives: "3x faster" over "significantly faster."

## Structure Preferences
- Open with a hook that creates a curiosity gap or states a surprising result.
- Keep paragraphs to 1-3 lines for mobile readability.
- Use line breaks generously — white space is a feature, not a bug.
- End with a specific call-to-action that invites real conversation.

## Topics of Expertise
- AI research papers explained simply
- AI agents and multi-agent architectures
- Business process automation with LLMs
- Practical AI implementation (not theory)
- Developer productivity and tooling

## What to Avoid
- Generic motivational content with no substance.
- Reposting news without adding original analysis.
- Sounding like a textbook or academic paper.
- Humble-bragging disguised as lessons learned.
- Posts that read like press releases or product pitches.
- Any phrase that could appear in a fortune cookie.
